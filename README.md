# HomeKit
An iOS Home Kit app

Developer: Dennis Lucero

contributer: David Florez

This is an iOS Home Kit application that uses table views to allow one to add homes, rooms, zones, and view, assign and control accessories.
It also has an simple iWatch component that just demonstrates the use of Watch Kit and how it connects to and communicates with the "main" app.
