An iOS Home Kit app

Developer: Dennis Lucero

This is an iOS Home Kit application that uses table views to allow one to add homes, rooms, zones, and view, assign and control accessories.
It also has an simple iWatch component that just demonstrates the use of Watch Kit and how it connects to and communicates with the "main" app.

This app  has been tested and works with  "The Hue light bulb starter kit".  It connects to and uses the Hue HUB, and contols the light bulbs.
